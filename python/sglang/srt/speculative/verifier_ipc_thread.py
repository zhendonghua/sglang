"""Verifier-side IPC thread (the recv daemon) for decoupled enumeration spec.

Control batches from the verifier are forwarded to the drafter over an injected
``BaseDecoupledSpecTransport``; enumeration buffer blocks received from the
drafter are landed into the verifier's GPU ``DecoupledEnumBuffer`` (verifier
routing + staleness live in ``DecoupledEnumBuffer.land``; each block row names
its own seat via the pool_idx echoed from DraftSync, so there is no host rid
lookup on this path). Envelope validation lives here; the wire lives in the
transport.

The loop body is factored into ``_step()`` so it can be driven directly (and
deterministically) by the fake-transport integration tests, while production
runs ``_run()`` on a daemon thread.
