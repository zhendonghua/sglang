"""Verifier-side scheduler collaborator for decoupled enumeration spec.

The scheduler delegates here once per batch result; everything else (wire,
landing, GPU select) lives in the IPC thread and the verify worker. The
manager owns:

- **Control plane bookkeeping** (host): an unseen rid gets a ``DraftSync``
  announcing the prompt, committed outputs, and its seat (req_pool_idx); each
  round's newly committed slice becomes a ``VerifyCommit``; a finished request
  sends ``DraftClose``. A seat change (retraction re-admit) re-syncs the full
  committed prefix -- the drafter-carried pool_idx protocol's only re-sync
  obligation.
- **The C6 launch gate** (``wait_for_select_blocks``, called by the verify
  worker at decode-launch, before the select gather): wait -- bounded --
  until the block each seat's select is about to read has landed. A timeout
  is never an error: that seat degrades to the unified fallback. Under the
  overlap scheduler the wait runs while the previous round still executes on
  the GPU, so up to a full verify round of drafter latency is hidden.
- **Hit / fallback accounting** from the worker's ``select_hits_queue``.

Expected arrival stamps are pure host math: the drafter stamps a block with
its total committed length (prompt + committed outputs) at enumeration time.
The block round M's select reads was enumerated two commits back, so its
stamp equals round M-1's ENTRY seq_lens + 1 -- each gate call arms the next
round's expectation from the batch it just gated; a DraftSync seeds the
first one. The first decode round of a request has no armed expectation
(under overlap its DraftSync has not even been sent when the round
launches) and simply falls back -- one round per request, by design.
